# ReactNative TODO App

ReactNative TODO App is [[https://github.com/yoyo-holdings][YOYO]]'s technical test.  This is a standard Mobile
application that provides a simple organizer for the user to store notes
and TODOs.

* Instructions

  1. Fork this repository on your own personal GitHub account.
  2. Download your fork, build this app, and begin making changes.
  3. When finished, create a Pull Request to merge into YOYO's version,
     then send an email to [[https://github.com/aindong][@aindong]] to let him know you're ready for
     review.
  4. We will close the pull request.

  You may also submit your commits using =git format-patch=, should you
  prefer it over GitHub PRs.

* Specifications

  1. The app consists of two major activities:
     - a note-taking activity that accepts a =title= and =text= for one
       or more notes
     - a TODO tracking activity that accepts an =entry=, with a
       =checkbox= to show whether this entry has been done or not done
  2. The app should have a user interface that allows for easy access
     between the note-taking and TODO tracking activities as well as to
     see their details at a glance.
  3. The note-taking activity should provide a view for its notes in a
     reverse-chronological order, with options for updating and deleting
     old notes.
  4. The TODO-tracking activity should provide a view for its entries
     with options for updating and deleting old TODOs.
  5. The app should make it easy to switch between the note-taking and
     TODO-tracking activities.
  6. The app should make it easy to switch a note to a TODO entry, and
     vice versa.
  7. The release APK should target Android devices running version 4.4
     (KitKat) and up.
